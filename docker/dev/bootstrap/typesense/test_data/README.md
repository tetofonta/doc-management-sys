We will add 50 files with tags and content and metadata.
there will be three users and two groups:
 - GROUPS:
    - groupone -> userone, usertwo
    - grouptwo -> userone, userthree
 - USERS
    - userone -> will be able to access as owner 10 files without group, and 20 files (10 + 10) as the two groups
    - usertwo -> will be able to access as owner 10 files without group and 10 files as group member
    - userthree -> will be able to access as owner 10 files without group and 10 files as group member

Then 5 documents will be linked between themselves in a mesh configuration.
